# What is this repository?
This repository is the main codebase for the API (Next.js with MongoDB) and the frontend (Next.js)

# How do I get started contributing?
Make sure you have a newish version of Node.js (Support for npm and stuff) and then clone this repo.
CD to the "client" directory (It's called client but really is both API and client right now) and then run "npm i" to install everything needed.
If you want to start the dev server just run "npm run dev".
